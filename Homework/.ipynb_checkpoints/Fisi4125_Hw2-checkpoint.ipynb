This is the most stable nucleus with the given atomic number. Have your program print out the value of $A$ for this most stable nucleus and the value of the binding energy per nucleon.\n",

At what value of $Z$ does the maximum binding energy per nucleon occur? (The true answer, in real life, is $Z = 28$, which is nickel. You should find that the semi-empirical mass formula gets the answer roughly right, but not exactly.)\n",
